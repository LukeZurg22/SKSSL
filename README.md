# SKSSL
This is a shared library. "SKSSL" stands for "SolKom Shared Standard Library" This was written in and for C#, and for particular use in the MonoGame engine with Gum UI.

## System Information
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Developer OS: Windows
- Intended OS('s): Windows & Linux (Maybe MacOS? Not sure.)
- Framework: Monogame DesktopGL 3.4.2+
- Language(s): C#, YAML, YML

## Program Goal
There is no defined goal for this Library. I develop it as I progress my skills as a game developer, sharing what I know and my active understanding of code as I progress.

## Limitations
Given that this isn't necessarily a program, the limitations are from C# version 9+ and the frameworks involved. The classes are meant to be as ubiquitous as can be, but very-distant versions past the one this was developed-in will likely cause issues.
